"aboutLocalization" = "Localization is the process of translating and adapting your app into multiple languages and regions. Localize your app to provide access for users who speak a variety of languages, and who download from different App Store territories. \n\nYou add a localization to your project and select the resources you want to include for that language and region. Export the localization and send the files to localizers, who translate the user-facing text and adapt resources for particular cultures and regions. Finally, you import the localized files and test the app in that language and region directly in Xcode. \n\nThis text language is being displayed according to the language used on your IOS. Try changing your IOS language and rerun the program. This example has support for English | Portuguese.";
